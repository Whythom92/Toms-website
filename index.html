	  <p> Hello this is a website I have created to showcase the skills I've learned from attending my software develper course. The course is 6 months of learning how to use Html, CSS and Javascript. The page has changed a lot from my very first upload and will continue to do so as I learn new skills. Happy browsing &#128512; </p></n>

	  <h2>About me</h2>
	  <p> Hi I'm Tom, I'm 31 years old and I live in Newcastle Upon Tyne with my      partner and our young son Fraser, oh and our dog! I like to spend qaulity time with  my little family by exploring the beautiful neighbouring sites. </p>
    <p> My main interests are gaming, football, bouldering, reading and socialising with friends.  I currently work at NCL1 fulfillment centre with Amazon, working on night shift as outbound problem solve. I chose this course as a means to build a new career path and finally hurdle over my struggles with using computers. I chose software developments as it seems like a creative venture allowing me to produce a useful platform for people to use. </p>
    <p> My aim is to successfully complete and obtain my certificate in software development and hopefully get a new job which allows me to grow my skills. </p>
